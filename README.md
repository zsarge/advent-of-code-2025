# Numbered Grid Project Template.

I've done enough challenges with a numbered grid, so I figured I'd make this a reusable template for myself.

These scripts are used across:
- <https://github.com/zsarge/ProjectEuler>
- <https://github.com/zsarge/advent-of-code-2021/>
- <https://github.com/zsarge/advent-of-code-2022/>
- ... More?

This is just for my personal use. Buyer beware.

## My Project Euler solutions:
(Click a number to view the associated solution.)
<!---
  This table is automatically generated and is best viewed with line wrap off.
  I did consider reference style links, and they didn't seem much better.
  Just try and view the formatted table, if you can.

| ---------------------------- | -- | -- | -- |
| 5                            | 6  | 7  | 8  |
| 9                            | 10 | 11 | 12 |

I have some scripts set up to make working on problems a smoother experience:

 - [`addSolution.rb`](addSolution.rb) takes a problem number, creates the associated folder and file, and copies the problem's prompt from the website.
 - [`generateReadme.rb`](generateReadme.rb) generates this readme based on the files in the solutions folder.

Every solution gets its own directory because I plan on varying the languages I use, and this keeps everything uniform.
